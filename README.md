# Game of Life

## Introduction

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the game grid and interface.
- **CSS:** Styles the game grid and enhances the visual presentation.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the game logic, including the rules of cell survival, birth, and death, as well as the animation of the grid over time.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Users can toggle cells' states (alive or dead) by clicking on them.
- **Start/Stop Simulation:** Control buttons to start and stop the simulation.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- **Clear Grid:** Reset the grid to the initial state.
